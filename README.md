## Description
_A tap room application built in React where a kombucha store can track their kegs and their remaining amount. The application meets the following user stories:_

* _As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store)._
* _As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list._
* _As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page_
* _As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints._
* _As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0._
